pitch: >
  ACM members at the University of Illinois are some of the most skillful,
  dedicated Computer Science and Engineering students in the world. The
  Corporate Committee makes it easy for employers and sponsors to interact
  with ACM members. ACM@UIUC would not be able to fund projects and events
  without the support of the CS department and generous sponsors. Funding
  from sponsorships goes into creating technical projects, building the
  infrastructure to support our members, and holding events for the
  CS@Illinois and broader campus community.

  The best way for companies to get involved with ACM@UIUC is to become a part
  of our corporate sponsorship program. If you have any questions please e-mail
  us at corporate@acm.illinois.edu. The Corporate Committee is ACM's central
  point of contact for all corporate relations activities.
