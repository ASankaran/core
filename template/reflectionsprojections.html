        Reflections | Projections, founded in 1995, is a technology conference operated by students in ACM@UIUC. Striving to cater to our community of students, alumni, and professionals, we provide a forum to share and learn about current advancements in computer science and its applications. We have tech talks from across the industry and academia, workshops and puzzle-solving events for attendees, Mechmania (our annual artificial intelligence programming competition), and Diversity Ã— Tech (a day of events celebrating diversity in tech). The entire conference is completely free for anyone to attend, regardless of age, major, or affiliation with UIUC.
        This year, Reflections | Projections will occur September 16th - September 21st. For more information, please visit the website: <a href = "http://reflectionsprojections.org/">http://reflectionsprojections.org/</a>
