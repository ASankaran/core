# Core

Core is a replacement for the core services in ACM@UIUC's current generation of infrastructure. Core is intended to be small and provide only the minimal set of functionality to run ACM@UIUC's website and membership managment. All other additional features should be implemented as microservices which can rely on Core for authentication and memberhip verification. See `design.md` for more details.
